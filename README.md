======================

Sample for Anypoint User Guide and Reference documentation, illustrating a connector that relies on SOAP web service access via CXF, and that exposes a POJO-based data model. 

The target service is the SunSetRise Service here:

www.webservicex.net/sunsetriseservice.asmx

WSDL is at:
www.webservicex.net/sunsetriseservice.asmx?WSDL

Note that this service requires no authentication, which simplifies the example.
